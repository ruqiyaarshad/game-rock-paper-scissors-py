# game-rock-paper-scissors
This repo contains code related to a Python-based game, "Rock, Paper, and Scissors". It is for practice purposes only, taken from the AI Sweigart book, "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"
I had changed variable names from those used in the book, just not to copy and paste someone else's work.
